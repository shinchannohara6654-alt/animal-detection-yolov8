\# Animal Detection System using YOLOv8



This project implements a real-time animal detection system using a webcam.

It uses the YOLOv8 object detection model to detect animals and draw bounding boxes in live video.



\## Features

\- Real-time webcam-based detection

\- Detects animals only (COCO dataset classes)

\- Confidence-based filtering for cleaner results

\- Saves detected output as a video file



\## Tech Stack

\- Python

\- YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)

\- OpenCV

\- PyTorch
